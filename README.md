Anoma Data Project 
Project Overview 
The Anoma Data project focuses on detecting anomalies in data using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can identify outliers and unusual patterns, helping businesses detect potential issues or insights from their data. 
Requirements 
To run this project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed: 
● Python 3.x 
● Google Colab (or Jupyter Notebook) 
● Pandas 
● NumPy 
● Scikit-learn 
● Matplotlib 
● Seaborn 
Files in the Project 
● AnomaData.xlsx: The dataset used for analysis and model training. ● anoma_data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook/Colab file containing the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps. 
● model.pkl: The trained machine learning model saved for deployment. ● report.pdf: The final report detailing the project's methodology and findings. ● README.txt: This file containing instructions on running the project. 
How to Run the Project 
1. Load the Dataset: 
○ If using Google Colab, upload AnomaData.xlsx using files.upload(). ○ Read the dataset using Pandas: df = 
pd.read_excel("AnomaData.xlsx"). 
2. Preprocess the Data: 
○ Handle missing values and outliers. 
○ Normalize or standardize numerical features. 
○ Encode categorical variables if present.
3. Train the Model: 
○ Split data into training and testing sets. 
○ Train a machine learning model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest). ○ Evaluate the model using performance metrics like RMSE, R², or accuracy. 4. Optimize the Model: 
○ Perform hyperparameter tuning. 
○ Use feature selection to improve performance. 
5. Save the Model: 
○ Save the trained model using joblib.dump(model, "model.pkl"). 6. Generate Reports: 
○ Visualize the data and results using Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
○ Summarize findings in the final report (report.pdf). 
Notes 
● If running in Jupyter Notebook, ensure all dependencies are installed using pip install -r requirements.txt. 
● The model can be reloaded using joblib.load("model.pkl") for further analysis.
